# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). <br>
This project was made for the SUTD 2022 Fifth Row Showcase. (I think? Idk I just offered to code this for fun lol.) <br>
Made for SUTD Mountaineering Club. Redefine your limits. <br>

## Available Scripts

You will have to first git clone the project. Make sure node.js is installed (along with the node package manager) <br>
In the project directory, you can then run: <br>
### `npm install`
### `npm run start-react`
This will start the server using react's standard hot-reload mode and run the app in the development mode. <br>
Normally you would run "npm start" instead, but the project has been modified to include express for uploading to a web server. <br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### 
Make sure you have Node installed to run the commands (Node include the node package manager, NPM)
