# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). <br>
This project was made for the SUTD 2022 Fifth Row Showcase. (I think? Idk I just offered to code this for fun.) <br>
Made for SUTD Mountaineering Club. Redefine your limits. <br>

## Available Scripts

You will to first git clone the project. Make sure node.js is installed (along with the node package manager)
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm run start-react`

Normally you would run "npm start" instead, but the project has been modified to include express for uploading to a web server.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
